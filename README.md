# FF-3-factor-Model
Replicate FF 3-factor Model

Hello!

This is a project to replicate Fama French 3-factor Model in Python.

FF+3+Factor+Model+Jun+23.ipynb 

replicates three factor model with monthly data of 5*5 Portfolios.

FF 3 Factor 25 Portfolios 10 Year Rolling Window.ipynb

replicates three factor model with monthly data of 5*5 Portfolios and with 10-year rolling windows

5 Factor Size Porfolio Daily Return Rolling Window_1.ipynb

replicates five factor model with daily data of three size portfolios and with 180-day rolling windows

5 Factor Size Porfolio Daily Return Rolling Window_2.ipynb

replicates five factor model with daily data of three size portfolios and with 180-day rolling windows, when smoothing set center = True

5 Factor Size Portfolio (quintile) Daily Return Rolling Window_2 (1).ipynb

replicates five factor model with daily data of three size portfolios and with 180-day rolling windows, when smoothing set center = True 
and added a plot of porfolio return volatility

R square and Factor Correlation and Significance Analysis.ipynb

replicates 5 factor model with both daily and montly data of 3/5/10 size portfolios, when smoothing set center = True
contrast the R squared, factor correlation and factor signifiance

plot number of firms in size portfolios.ipynb

as title

Factor+Explaining+Proportion.ipynb

use 5 factor model, daily data, three size portfolios, calculate the proportion of return predicted by Mrk-Rf (and other factors)
