For factor model, or CAPM model
    How to estimate BETA, i.e., What length of historical data should be used? 
    Are all the stocks has stable Beta estimation? What is the confidence level?
    How much can we get really from data regards the CAPM model?
    To what extent is the model stable and useful? Think of this in different universe, over the history, normal or extreme market periods, positive and negative months.

For Momentum factor as an example
    Should we define the factor as a momentum portfolio return in the linear equition or a standerized stock specific momentum values(exposure)
    portfolio return approach
        unit match as we have returns on the right hand side.
        the portfolio is bit artficial as it is not like market factor where individual stock is indeed affected by systematic drivers which affect the whole market.
